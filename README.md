# FPGA-Matrix-Multiplication

Matrix multiplication implemented with VHDL for Intel DE10 Board. 
A FIFO was used for one implementation, and a FIFO was not used for the other. 
Comparison in terms of clock cycles, registers, memory, and number of multipliers are shown in the report.
Can be run using ModelSim and Quartus.
